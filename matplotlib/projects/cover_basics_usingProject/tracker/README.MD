WHAT DO YOU THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE/ADD AND WE HAVE TO SHOW WHEN WE TRY TO DISPLAY SOMETHING REGARDING OUR EXPENSES OR IT COULD BE MY DIET TRACKER OR ANY TRACKER?

ANS: ITS WHAT I NEED TO ACHIEVE IN THOSE RESPECTIVE DAYS, ISN'T IT?

I BELIEVE AS A PROGRAMER ITS NOT ONLY OUR WORK TO CODE/PROGRAM BUT ALSO TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE WE CREATING, HOW ARE WE CREATING, WHY ARE WE CREATING -> THE SAME WH QUESTIONS


THE NEW TOPICS I DISCOVER WHILE MAKING THIS PROJECTS ARE:
 1.1 subplot(2,3,figsize=(50,30))
 IT IS USED TO MAKE VARIOUS GRAPH IN ONE DISPLAY, HERE 2,3 REPRESENTS ROW AND COLUMN WHERE 2 REPRESENTS ROWS AND 3 REPRESENTS COLUMNS AND FIGURE SIZE(FIGSIZE) REPRESENTS THE FIGURE SIZE

 1.2 subtitle("title name",fontsize=in_numbers)
 IT'S USE TO GIVE NAME OR REPRESENT THE MULTIPLE GRAPH BY GIVING A TITLE NAME

 1.3 plot()-> always remember x,y,c,s,w,m,l
 WHERE:
  C IS COLOR, S IS LINESTYLE, W IS LINEWIDTH, M IS MARKER AND L IS LABEL

  1.4 pie()-> IT TAKES X,LABEL,AUTOPCT,COLOR'S

  1.5 scatter()-> ITS VERY SIMILAR TO PLOT WHEN IT COMES TO VARIABLES INSIDE THE SCATTER() FUNCTION EXCEPT IT DOESNT TAKES LINESTYLE,LINEWIDTH,LABEL AND IT DOESNT HAS A LINE AND ONLY HELPS TO VISUALIZE USING DOTS IN GRAPH
