🐍 PYTHON LEARNING JOURNEY

“Learning by building, improving by experimenting.”

📘 About This Repository

This repository documents my learning journey in Python, where I explore programming fundamentals, libraries, and real world applications.
I’m currently learning and experimenting with:

. Python basics (syntax, functions, loops, OOP)

. Data tools – NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib

. File handling, JSON, and small project implementations

Note: This repository is updated periodically.
I’m learning from scratch and working independently — progress may be slow, but it’s consistent and improving with time.

. Weekly Progress & Projects
. Week 1 – Python Fundamentals

Concepts Covered:

Variables & Data Types

Syntax & Control Flow (loops, conditionals)

Functions & OOP

Collections & Enumerators

Practice Projects:

Small beginner projects to apply core concepts

. Week 2 – Exploring Libraries & Tools

Focus: NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas

Installation:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib


Goals:

Understanding data handling with NumPy & Pandas

Visualizing data using Matplotlib

Applying libraries to simple, practical projects

Projects:

. MARKS_ANALYSIS

. IMAGE_PROCESSING

. Week 3 – Continuing Beginner-Friendly Projects

Current Work:

. SIMULATE_TEMPERATURE (in progress)

. Upcoming Plans
