About This Repository

This repository is a work in progress as I learn and explore Python. I am currently building my skills in Python programming, including core concepts, libraries, and data analysis tools. I experiment with different Python libraries and tools such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and others to apply my learning in practical projects.

Note: The repository will be updated periodically. As I am learning from scratch and working independently, updates may not always be consistent, but I aim to improve continuously.

Projects Overview
WEEK 1: Python Basics 

Covers fundamental concepts:

Variables & Data Types

Syntax & Control Flow (loops, conditionals)

Functions & OOP
