json is an javascript object notation
IT IS USED TO STORE KEY VALUE

CORE CONCEPT TO KNOW BEFORE USING JSON IN PYHTON:

1. WE NEED TO IMPORT JSON -> import json

2. WE NEED TO CONVERT PYTHON OBJECTS LIKE LIST,DICT INTO JSON STRING -> json.dumps(variable)

3. WE NEED TO CONVERT JSON STRING BACK INTO PYTHON OBJECTS -> json.loads(variable)

4. WE USE (INDENT=NUMBER OR NUMBER'S) TO REPRESENT HOW MANY SPACE WE WANT TO ADD WHILE FORMATTING PYTHON OBJECT INTO JSON FORMAT
