AT FIRST, THE PROJECT ARE DESIGN AND MADE FOR MY PERSONAL LEARNING AND UNDERSTANDING. I DIDN'T CAME WITH THE THOUGHT JUST MAKE THE PROJECT BUT ALSO TO EXPLAIN IT TO MYSELF AND IF SOMEBODY IS READING THIS THEN TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND TOO. 

I HAVE TRIED NUMPY FOR THE FIRST 3-4 DAYS AND student_marks_analysis.py IS MY FIRST PROJECT USING NUMPY AND NOW I AM GOING TO LEARN MATPLOTLAB TO VISUALIZE THE DATA IN REAL LIFE.

I DON'T PROMISE TO MAKE THIS CONTENT SOLELY FOR ANYONE USE BUT FOR MY OWN KNOWLEDGE MOSTLY. SO, THE READERS DON'T COMPLAIN PLEASE. -> MIGHT DELETE LATER
